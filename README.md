# Bill Managment
What happens when you forget to pay your bills and you're studying computer science?
You end up creating simple java application which keeps track of bill payments.

This application uses javax.mail library to send information about paid bills
and pictures of paid bills to my landlord.

This is one of the first applications in which I used javax.mail library for
sending emails.
